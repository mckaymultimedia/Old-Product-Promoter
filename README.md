# Old Product Promoter for WordPress Woocommerce Products

This is a modified version of the Old Post Promoter WordPress plugin that works for Woocommerce products.

Note: The ability to exclude by product category isn't working properly yet. Post categories are shown in the place of what should be product categories and the option in the database for storing the categories remains NULL no matter what is selected. I am still working to correct that. Any Pull Requests in that area are welcome.
